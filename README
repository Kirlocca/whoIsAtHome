Requirements: 
arp-scan  (network scanning tool)

What it does:
whoishome scans the local network for devices and writes the IP and MAC addresses to scanresults.txt.
mappersons.py then maps known MAC addresses to Names and writes the names to personshome.txt.
The contents of personshome.txt are printed to command line.

How to run: 
execute whoishome

What to tweak:
mappersons.py contains a dictionary. Edit the known MACs or Names. You can also add IPs instead of MACs.
